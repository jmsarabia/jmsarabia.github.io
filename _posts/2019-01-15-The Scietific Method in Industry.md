The scientific method we learned in elementary school is just as prevalent in our lives today, particularly to data scientists. As an undergrad student, I found that while it is unsurprising that researchers such as graduate students and professors are using the method for their academic endeavors, it *is* surprising that data scientists out in the wilds of industry employ the method almost daily.

At presentations given by data scientists employed at well-known start-up companies (which will not be named due to NDA's/favoritism issues), all of them have talked to varying degrees about their day-to-day work. Some only briefly mention their work, while others gave their entire presentation around a theoretical single project.  In either case, the presenters noticeably outline the same general steps that roughly translate to the scientific method.


The scientific method follow these general steps:



Similarly, data scientists in industry, regardless of title or position, logically follow the same general steps. In most companies, the questions are not formed by the researchers, but rather asked by a higher-up such as a project manager.
