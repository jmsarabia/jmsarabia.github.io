As an undergraduate at USF, one of the first schools to have an explicit _undergraduate_ Data Science degree that is not a concentration of a Math or Computer Science degree, I was lucky enough to observe as the field grew exponentially. When I was freshman, people had no idea what my degree entails, whereas now... people generally still do not know what data science is. However, due to the overwhelming volume of data created every second, more people are starting to understand that there is going to be a need for data scientists, and so they are looking for people that are trained to understand the truths in that data.

Unfortunately, that training is difficult to obtain in an undergrad degree alone. As a disclaimer, I am not knocking on USF's degree program - the curriculum is fantastic and I have loved every second of learning from and working with the professors and students there. I am, however, going to knock on the fact that there is, at its core, not enough time in an undergrad degree to create an effective data scientist.

Now wait, a few of you 11 readers out there would say "Hold on, an undergraduate degree is usually four years, that's plenty of time to become any profession!" To which I would respond: normally, yes. However, you would be underestimating two very large factors: the implications of college, and the implications of a data scientist.

For the college implications, that includes all the social growth that coincides with academic growth. As unscientific as this sounds, as our courseload grows, so do we as individuals. Many move to new cities, live with complete strangers, join clubs to find their people, and are forced to explore their surroundings. College is where we define ourselves, where we manage the schol-work-life balance, and where we set our goals for who we want to become. That final part includes finding our passion amidst all the General Education and intro major classes we have to take.


And that leads me to the implications of a data scientist, which are related to the requirement of being great at several non-trivial things. With all the classes we have to take just to understand the basics of the basics (e.g understanding the Gaussian distribution or setting up a Python environment), undergraduate students typically cannot learn the worthwile or useful techniques that constitute a data scientist until the latter portion of their education, at which point they do not have enough time to participate in research or prepare for the workforce with their knowledge. Essentially, there is not enough time with too much to learn. 


For example, there is a certain progression of classes we have to take in order to take the main achine learning course, as we need linear regression, which in turn needs linear algebra, calculus, and statistics, which in turn needs probability. That machine learning course is especially important because many students, myself included, do not feel comfortable applying for internships or doing researach as we feel we do not know enough without it. On top of that, if we miss a single course due to scheduling or for any other reason, then we end up unable to take the course we so desparately need as data scientists.

And that lack of knowledge is especially felt when looking at job postings. Even for data science internships, which should be lowest rung of possible employment, the requirements are so high (e.g. requirements: Spark experience, NPL training) that only masters students or seniors graduating meet the requirements. But graduating seniors would be looking for full time jobs, which generally require relevant experience such as related internships, which they would not have because they never qualified for them as underclassmen.


Ultimately, everybody has to take some form of a mental break. If there is somebody out there that never tires from learning, then they truly are lucky. However, I for one need to take a break from learning, even when it is something I so thoroughly enjoy. And with the rest of college taking up time, there is no possible way an undergrad degree alone can cover everything a data scientist needs to know. And that is why it is so dang troublesome.
