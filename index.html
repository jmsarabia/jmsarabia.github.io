  	<h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="/assets/images/headshot.jpg" alt="Personal Headshot" style="float:left; width:158px; height:180x;">
    <p> </br>My name is Jared Sarabia, an analyst with a passion for data science. Officially, I am an analyst working in the public sector, analyzing and providing solutions for logistics problems, while also streamlining processes by integrating natural language processing into current business practices. Outside of work, I am building to my Master's of Science in Data Science at Northwestern University. Which is all a formal way of saying I'm a data enthusiast that's loving my explorations into this field.

    <p>
        This site acts as my repository for my projects, my resume, and any personal thoughts regarding data science and my personal journey through the field.
        Most projects are technical, as I learn certain methods or models, while others are explorations into my interests such as food waste, climate change, basketball, and rock climbing.
