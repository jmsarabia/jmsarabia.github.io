    <p> </br>My name is Jared Sarabia, and I'm a data scientist hopeful. Officially, that means I'm a graduating Senior Data Science student at the University of San Francisco
        looking for a job in the data science field. Which is the formal way of saying I'm a data enthusiast that's loving my explorations into this field.
    </p>
    <p>
        This site acts as my repository for my projects as well as my blog posts regarding data science and my personal journey through the field.
        Most projects are technical, as I learn certain methods or models, while others are more related to my interests such as basketball. 
      </br></br></br>
        Now for the shameless plug: my CV and contact information can also be found through the menu bar, so if you if you have a possible 
        hiring opportunity, please feel free to contact me!
