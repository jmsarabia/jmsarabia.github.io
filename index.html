    <p> </br>My name is Jared Sarabia, and I'm a data scientist hopeful. Officially, that means I'm a graduating Senior Data Science student at the University of San Francisco
        looking for a job in the data science field. Which is the formal way of saying I'm a data enthusiast that's loving my explorations as I look for ways to wield data 
        to better humanity.

    <p>
        This site acts as my repository for all my projects as well as my blog posts regarding data science and my personal journey through the field.
        Most projects are technical, as I learn certain methods or models, while others are more related to my interests such as basketball. 

        Now for the shameless plug: my CV/ontact information are also in the menu bar at the top, so if you if you have a possible 
        hiring opportunity, please feel free to contact me!
