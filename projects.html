    <h2><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jmsarabia8/introducing-the-titanic-a-learning-exercise/">Kaggle's Titanic Project</a></h2>
    <p>
      The Kaggle Titanic Project is one of the first data science tutorials that a learner will encounter, in which you have to predict if a passenger would survive given data about passengers. At it's base, it is a classification and regression problem, and can be resolved with various modelling techniques. I wrote this notebook as a note to myself as well as to teach my underclassmen in the Data Science Association the usual workflow for a data science project.
      The link to the notebook can be found here: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jmsarabia8/introducing-the-titanic-a-learning-exercise/">Introducing The Titanic - A Learning Exercise</a>

    <h2><a href="https://jmsarabia.github.io/NBAPlayerComparator/">NBA Player Comparator</a></h2>
    <p>
      The NBA Player Comparator visualizes the stats of basketball players players from the National Basketball Association (NBA) from the past up until the 2016-2017 NBA season. The comparator visualizes two players at a time, comparing their overall career stats, followed by their season-by-season stats. This was built with NBA fans in mind, as well as the general public who may not know too much about basketball but are interested in some of the top players of the NBA history. Please read the full README here: <a href = "https://github.com/jmsarabia/NBAPlayerComparator/blob/master/README.md">README</a>
