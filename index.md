### Projects
[Funding Proposal to Combat Synthetic Opiods](/pdf/opiod_crisis_analysis.pdf) - 
<a href="https://github.com/robords/fentanyl_eda">(Github)</a> 
<br>
Acting as a consulting firm, this team project scrapes, cleans, and analyzes public mortality data to better inform state and federal government organizations on geographic locations and specific demographics to support to fight the Fentanyl crisis. Predictions on future mortality in counties are made through tree-based and regression methods.

[Identifying Skillsets Required for Data Science Positions by Applying Various NLP Techniques on Scraped Job Postings](/pdf/Sarabia_Job_Description_Report.pdf) - 
<a href="https://github.com/jmsarabia/topic-modeling-skillsets">(Github)</a>
<br>
I identify the skills and technologies related to various data scinece positions - such as data analyst, data engineer, and data scientist - through recent natural language processing (NLP) techniques that model topics within a set of documents, in this case job postings. Methods implemented are LDA, Top2Vec, and BERTopic. The effectiveness of each technique is evaluated based on the coherence, or "likeness", of job postings grouped into the extracted topics. Furthermore, each technique is rated on various performance metrics such as required dataset size, semantic embedding usage, and necessary computational resources.
