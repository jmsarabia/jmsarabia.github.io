[Funding Proposal to Combat Synthetic Opiods](/pdf/opiod_crisis_analysis.pdf) <br>
Acting as a consulting firm, this team project scrapes, cleans, and analyzes public mortality data to better inform state and federal government organizations on geographic locations and specific demographics to support to fight the Fentanyl crisis. Predictions on future mortality in counties are made through tree-based and regression methods.

[Identifying Highly Relevant Skills for Data Science Positions Captured 2023 through Topic Modeling with LDA, Top2Vec, and BERTopic](/pdf/Sarabia_Job_Description_Report.pdf) <br>
I identify the skills related to certain data scinece positions - such as data analyst, data engineer, and data scientist - through natural language processing (NLP) techniques that model topics within a set of documents, in this case job postings. The effectiveness of each technique is evaluated based on the coherence, or "likeness", of job postings grouped into the extracted topics. Furthermore, each technique is rated on various performance metrics. Data was obtained through scraped job posting descriptions hosted on Kaggle.
